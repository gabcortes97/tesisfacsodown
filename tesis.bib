This article argues that this thesis may not be appropriate to understand societies with different cultural traditions and institutional practices. Based upon the results of qualitative research conducted in Chile the article discusses the existence of a specific path to individuation in this society. The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

This paper proposes to explore this link through three major movements. Firstly, it briefly revises the ways in which the link between individualism and social movements has been routinely analyzed in social sciences. Secondly, it suggests the ways in which both individualism and social movements should be understood in the context of Latin America. Finally, from this reconsideration, it analyzes the specific tensions between both social phenomena in this region.           ,              RESUMO A articula\c{c}\~ao entre individualismo e movimentos sociais \'e uma quest\~ao amplamente debatida nas ci\^encias sociais estadunidenses e europeias, mas relativamente ausente no quadro da sociologia latino-americana.

  abstract = {Latin American and East Asian cultures are generally considered to be collectivistic cultures. However, there are very few cross-cultural studies contrasting these two cultures against each other, as most studies in this field compare them to Western culture. Self-construal is one of the most used constructs to explain cultural differences, elucidating whether individuals of a cultural group see themselves as independent of their environment and others, focusing on personal motivations, or interdependent of others and their context, recognizing their role within it. This study intends to compare the self-construal of Chileans and South Koreans and observe the variability in the presence of these dimensions in these two cultures. A total of 200 participants from Chile and South Korea responded to the Self-Construal Scale. Chileans presented significantly higher scores on independent and interdependent self-construal simultaneously when compared to South Koreans. Also, Chileans presented higher scores on independent self-construal than on interdependent self-construal, while Koreans did not show a preference for either dimension. These results are consistent with previous studies on Chileans, implying that not all Latin American countries would adhere to collectivism.},

We identify major contradictions between the two culture models, which result in contradictory relationships with external variables such as economic prosperity. We critically evaluate the content validity of the items used to measure this construct in both models. Based on our analysis, we suggest that Hofstede's Individualism\textendash Collectivism index be relabelled as Self-orientation vs Work-orientation and GLOBE's In-group collectivism as Family Collectivism. We demonstrate how the proposed alternative conceptualizations of the Individualism\textendash Collectivism dimensions in both the Hofstede and GLOBE models can help reconcile the anomalous relationships between these two models of national culture, and between their dimension scores and other external variables of interest to researchers. We recommend a way forward for future research incorporating the collectivism dimensions that identifies which of the Hofstede/GLOBE scores is appropriate for differing purposes. This will help to make future research findings clearer, and to reduce contradictions and anomalies. Implications drawn from such research should also be clearer as a result.},

The article explores the latter topic by drawing on recent comparative survey data from nine countries, both young and consolidated democracies from Europe and Latin America. Two individual-level characteristics trigger particularly strong support for the replacement of politicians with experts: low political efficacy and authoritarian values. They are complemented by a third, somewhat weaker factor: corruption perception. At the macro level, technocracy appeals to citizens of countries where the quality of democracy is deficient and where technocratic cabinets are a part of historical legacy. Surprisingly, civic activism and, partially, satisfaction with democracy enhance technocratic orientation, indicating such attitudes are not expressions of alienation or depoliticisation.},

Inspired by the approach of the individual advocated by \'Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons and John Meyers, it first outlines the general script of the individual-as-actor that informs modern individualism as well as the generic characteristics that are routinely attributed to persons such as agency and free will. It subsequently reconstructs three predominant interpretations of this general script, i.e. utilitarian, moral and expressive individualism. For each variant, the intellectual genesis and overall definition of the institutionalization in specific societal domains and the dominant articulations in social theory are briefly presented. With this threefold distinction, the aim is to synthesize the extensive literature on individualism and to show the sociological strengths of approaching subjectivity in terms of institutionalized scripts.},

Today, however, the conditions seem to be ripe for the consolidation of the PRR in the country. As we show in           this contribution, Jos\'e Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano advance a programmatic agenda that emphasizes authoritarian, nativist, and           populist ideas. We also demonstrate certain peculiarities of this political project, which differentiates it from its European brethren. In           fact, the party has adopted very clear neoliberal positions and puts much more emphasis on outgroup distinctions within rather than outside           the nation. Moreover, given that Jos\'e Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano maintain a very fluid relationship with the mainstream right,           collaboration between the two seems much simpler and more feasible than in most European cases.},

This follows from assumptions that these parties have rhetorical, stylistic and practical critiques of liberal democracy that appeal to people with politically authoritarian attitudes. I use Module 5 Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data and Wave 7 World Values Survey data to test how authoritarian attitudes, in particular, approval of strong, unchecked leaders, may be associated with support for RRP parties. Of 12 unique cases where RRP parties received at least 5\% support in a recent election, in most cases preferences for strong, unchecked leaders differentiated RRP party supporters from supporters of other parties generally, and from supporters of centre-right parties. In some cases, negative views of democracy, and acceptance of army rule, also characterized RRP supporters. Most cases have evidence consistent with the hypotheses, with the strongest evidence from supporters of Austria's FP\"O and Germany's AfD.},

  abstract = {Recent research to analyze and discuss cultural differences has employed a combination of five major dimensions of individualism\textendash collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity\textendash masculinity (gender role differentiation), and long-term orientation. Among these dimensions, individualism\textendash collectivism has received the most attention. Chronologically, this cultural attribute has been regarded as one, then two, and more recently, four dimensions of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism. However, research on this issue has not been conclusive and some have argued against this expansion. The current study attempts to explain and clarify this discussion by using a shortened version of the scale developed by Singelis et al. ((1995) Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: a theoretical and measurement refinement. Cross-Cultural Research 29(3): 240\textendash 275). Our analysis of aggregate data from 802 respondents from nine countries supports the expanded view. Data aggregation was based on the Mindscape Theory that proposes inter- and intracultural heterogeneity. This finding is reassuring to scholars who have been using the shortened version of the instrument because confirmatory factor analysis indicated its validity. The findings of the present study provides clarification of some apparent ambiguity in recent research in specifying some cultures such as India, Israel, and Spain as individualists or collectivists. By separating the four constructs, more nuanced classification is possible. Also, such a distinction enables us to entertain such concepts as the Mindscape Theory that proposes a unique intracultural and transcultural heterogeneity that do not stereotype the whole culture as either individualist or collectivist.},

These alternatives have become increasingly popular, especially in countries where strong political disaffection and previous favourable pro-expert attitudes exist simultaneously. The Spanish case is one of these settings, with the emergence of a political party, Ciudadanos (Citizens), that represents these ideas. This article contributes to the understanding of public opinion support for an expert government, its main motives, and social supports. We claim that experts are not so much a decision-making alternative as they are a desired piece of the decision-making process. Support for a more significant role for experts comes especially from those that credit them with ample technical capacities, but most citizens want them to work as a piece of representative government, not as an alternative to it. The article combines two types of evidence: A survey of a representative sample of the population, including innovative questions about support to expert governments, and 10 focus groups that allow a more in-depth comprehension of the support (and criticism) of an increased role for experts. The results provide a nuanced picture of the types of expert involvement sought and their respective social support.},

  abstract = {This article is divided into four parts which move the discussion from authenticity to consumerism to charismatic authority. The introduction discusses ``what is authenticity,'' and how social sciences can address the question. The article argues that authenticity claims can be classified in different registers, which in turn are part of overarching, socio-historical regimes. The rise of the culture of authenticity is the product of a change in such regimes, which have shifted from a ``national-statist'' to a new consumerist or ``market'' regime in the wake of the consumer revolution of the 1960s and the latest wave of economic globalisation. The third section turns to the issue of religious authority, starting with the diagnosis that consumer cultures are prone to a shift from rational-legal to charismatic types of authority, in reference to Max Weber's typology. In response to the question as to why charismatic authorities arise in capitalist cultures, the article argues to their structural and coextensive nature. Finally, the last section revises Weber's typologies with the help of Mauss's Essay on the Gift and a contribution from sociologist Alain Caill\'e and develops some of their heuristic potential.},

We find that people who feel more socially marginal\textemdash because they lack strong attachment to the normative order, social engagement, or a sense of social respect\textemdash are more likely to be alienated from mainstream politics and to support radical parties. We also find an association between indicators for recent economic and cultural developments often said to affect social status and feelings of social marginalization, especially among people with low incomes or educational attainment.

Roughly up to 50\% of voters in East Asia have delegative democratic attitudes, which are known to undermine democratic governance in new democracies. Understanding delegative democratic attitudes is thus closely linked to the question of why delegative democracy persists. Our theoretical analysis suggests that delegative democratic attitudes are associated with low support for democracy, a perception of the strong influence of interest groups on policy, and trust in a national leader who can counter the power of interest groups. Using Asian Barometer Survey data from East Asian countries, 2001\textendash 2011, we confirm the hypotheses. Our findings imply that transforming a delegative democracy into a consolidated democracy requires promoting support for democracy and preventing interest group dominance over public policy.},

Study 2 used Triandis's horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism framework in samples from Bulgaria, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, Poland, Canada, and the United States (total N = 1,018). Both at the individual level and the societal level of analysis, authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism and vertical collectivism but unrelated to horizontal collectivism. Horizontal individualism was unrelated to authoritarianism except in post-Communist societies whose recent history presumably made salient the incompatibility between state authority and self-determination.},

The Chilean sample reports a higher score on both constructs. Both samples report the highest score on independence. The results are inconsistent with previous models that characterize Chile as collectivistic and Norway as individualistic. These characterizations are questioned. The findings also imply that a particular score on either independence or interdependence does not predict the score on the opposite variable.

We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (N = 5,741) demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies' development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.},

  abstract = {A pesar del creciente descontento con la pol\'itica, manifiesto en las democracias emergentes y consolidadas por igual, el apoyo ciudadano hacia la democracia parec\'ia estable en la mayor\'ia de los pa\'ises. Recientemente, sin embargo, algunos estudios han encontrado indicios de un aumento en el desapego hacia los valores e instituciones democr\'aticos. El presente estudio argumenta que una manifestaci\'on espec\'ifica del distanciamiento hacia la democracia es la indiferencia pol\'itica: la opini\'on de que da lo mismo vivir en un r\'egimen democr\'atico que en uno autoritario. Este planteamiento se basa en un an\'alisis de cuatro encuestas realizadas en 18 pa\'ises de Am\'erica Latina entre 2013 y 2017. La evidencia muestra que, si bien la preferencia por la democracia es mayoritaria en la regi\'on, se trata de una mayor\'ia poco robusta. Un segmento considerable de la poblaci\'on, no obstante, se declara indiferente antes que inclinarse por el autoritarismo. El an\'alisis indica que la indiferencia pol\'itica est\'a asociada con un mayor descontento con el desempe\~no del sistema pol\'itico. Asimismo, es m\'as probable que las personas que se declaran indiferentes conf\'ien menos en los dem\'as, que sean mujeres o j\'ovenes, que tengan un bajo nivel educativo o que tengan un menor bienestar en el hogar. Estos resultados sugieren que, para un n\'umero considerable de ciudadanos, la democracia es un referente abstracto que dif\'icilmente alcanza motivar apego pol\'itico.},

These studies have mostly looked at support for citizens or independent experts being given a greater role. Recently, Hibbing, Theiss-Morse, Hibbing and Fortunato have proposed a new battery of 21 survey items capturing the dimensions along which citizens' preferences for who should govern are organized. Testing their survey instrument among US respondents, they identified seven dimensions. In this study, we replicate their approach across nine European democracies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands. The replication allows, first, to compare citizens' preferences for political actors between the US and Europe, and within Europe. Second, it provides suggestions for how Hibbing and colleagues' battery might be adapted and re-used in other countries, enabling further cross-national comparative research on citizens' preferences for who should govern.},

This is a survey-based descriptive study, with a sample of 558 administrative employees of three different organizations. Results support the idea that individualism and collectivism are not opposite dimensions, that coexist and may complement each other. The Chilean society remains collectivist but horizontal individualism is emerging and becoming more important. Both vertical and horizontal collectivism are positively related with age, years worked in the same place, and negatively associated with educational level. Women get higher ratings of horizontal individualism and men get higher vertical collectivism ratings. Using cluster analysis five different segments were found: independent collectivists, pure collectivists, idiocentric collectivists, alocentric individualists and renegades. Finally, potential causes and implications of these findings are discussed.},

The scale also defines two dimensions of collectivism: (a) advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions) and (b) harmony (seeking to avoid conflict). The AICS avoids the need for measuring horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism and the confounding effect of familialism on the collectivism\textemdash individualism constructs.},

This study also examines the association between political placement and welfare attitudes. Data from the European Social Survey (N = 37,743 in 20 countries) are analyzed using a two-level regression analysis. The findings indicate that individualism at the cultural culture is a significant factor in terms of individuals' attitudes to welfare, in that the higher the level of individualism, the lesser the likelihood that the state's welfare responsibility is supported. On the other hand, citizens' attitudes towards state responsibility for welfare are associated with the political placement of those citizens. Politically, people leaning to the right have a lower degree of interest in the state's welfare responsibility. Furthermore, the degree of individualism modifies the association at the individual level of political placement and welfare attitudes. There is a greater attitudinal difference between the supporters of right-wing and left-wing political views in individualistic countries than in collectivist countries. From a social policy perspective, this study emphasizes the association of individualism and welfare attitudes. The results suggest that social policy is based more on national cultural values than one might assume.},

In the current research, we tested the hypothesis that although such a pattern predicts support for a strong non-democratic leader in democracies, it should produce decreased support for a strong non-democratic leader in non-democracies (where the presence of such leaders is the political status quo). Using three waves of World Values Survey data (2005-2020), as predicted, we found that in democracies, low economic development, high inequality, and low interpersonal trust predicted support for a strong non-democratic leader. However, in non-democracies, support for a strong non-democratic leader was higher in more economically developed countries and among individuals with higher social trust. These results contradict modernization theory's proposition that development promotes support for democratic rule and suggest that economic development reinforces support for the existing political system.},
